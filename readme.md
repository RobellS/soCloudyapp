# Purpose of the project 
With colder weather moving into the tri-state, knowing  the temperature outside can vastly aid in choices from outfit, to schedule, and many other aspects of your life. Many of these weather apps require your constant location to give updates to temperature. With the evergrowing concerns for online privacy & security, I have decided on a retro approach with this application. This will search for the temperature in a city that is input in the search bar without the need of any addition meta data on the user.

# Target end-user for this program
The ideal end-user is a privacy-focused user that wants the convenience of checking weather without having other information taken, all while enjoying a robust library of photos of the very city they input.
